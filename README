Hello ^^.
Hope you are having a good day.
Hope I have fullfilled requirements this time.
What has been edited after first rejection :- 
1- Error handling for negative and zero values of width and height
2- build script
3- test for resizing process and resized image
4- Try/Catch error handler for unexpected errors
5- separating dev-dependencies and dependencies

Structure :-
dist --> consist of compiled ts files to js
original --> consist of images to be processed
resized --> consist of images after processing
spec --> consist of jasmine config file
src --> consist of (module folder that have module and middlewares - routes that have all routes - test folder - main app file which server is built in)

Scripts involved :- 
format --> to apply prettier options and modify code style
lint --> to check syntax and provide errors if exist
test --> first to build app and compile it to JS then to test it with jasmine
start --> starts the app 

Endpoints involved :-
http://localhost:5000/api/image/resize?name=&width=&height=
this url takes name, width and height to resize the image with this name to that specific width and height

Middlewares :-
in this app there are two middlewares:
1- queryValidation --> this ensures the data is entered and check file path before processing the image
2- existValidation --> this ensures that this image haven't been processed before
